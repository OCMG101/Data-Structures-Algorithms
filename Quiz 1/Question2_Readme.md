# Array Rotation
This C program rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps (k). The rotation is performed in-place without using additional space.

## Overview
The program provides the following features:<br>

Array Rotation: The rotate function is implemented to rotate the array to the right by the specified number of steps (k). 
It uses the concept of reversing portions of the array to achieve the rotation in-place. <br>

Reversal Function: The reverse function reverses a specified portion of the array.<br>

Example Usage: The main function demonstrates the usage of the rotate function with a sample array. 
The original array and the rotated array are printed for verification.<br>

## Result
The result of the above program will be:

Original Array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>
Rotated Array: 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 <br>
