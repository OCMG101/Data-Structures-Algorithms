# Array Operations in C
This C program demonstrates basic array operations by calculating the sum of integers in an array and finding the maximum integer. The user is prompted to input the length of the array (n) and each element of the array. The program then calls functions to calculate the sum and find the maximum, displaying the results.

## Features
Summation Function: Calculates the sum of integers in the array.<br>
Maximum Function: Finds the maximum integer in the array.<br>
User Input: Takes user input for the length of the array and its elements.<br>
Error Handling: Ensures non-negative array length input.<br>
